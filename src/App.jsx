const FAQ = [
  { q:"Is the trial really free?", a:"Yes, one full class with a teacher, no credit card required." },
  { q:"How do I book my free trial?", a:"Pick a course, tell us your timezone and a time that suits you, and we'll match you with a teacher for one complete class." },
  { q:"What if I've never seen Urdu before?", a:"Perfect. Most students start from the alphabet; we assess and place you correctly." },
  { q:"Can I choose my class times?", a:"Yes. Tell us your timezone and availability and we schedule around you." },
  { q:"Can I reschedule a class?", a:"Yes. With reasonable notice we'll move a 1:1 class to another slot that suits you. Structured courses like GCSE prep follow a fixed weekly schedule, but every session is recorded so you never miss the material." },
  { q:"When does the GCSE Urdu course run?", a:"It's 16 weeks, one 60-minute session a week, on a fixed day and time agreed with your teacher when you enroll." },
  { q:"How do the 1:1 bundles work?", a:"Pick 4, 8, or 12 classes a month — 30 minutes each for kids, 50 minutes each for women. The more you book, the faster you progress, and your teacher plans each month around your goals." },
  { q:"When do the Summer and Back-to-School courses run?", a:"The Summer Urdu Course runs July through mid-August; the Back-to-School Urdu Course runs late August through September. Both are 6 weeks, two 30-minute sessions a week." },
  { q:"Are classes recorded?", a:"Every class is recorded and saved to your dashboard to rewatch anytime." },
  { q:"What are your teachers' qualifications?", a:"Every teacher is a native Urdu speaker with a formal qualification — in Urdu literature, linguistics, or education — plus years of online teaching experience." },
  { q:"Do I get a certificate?", a:"Yes. We track your progress throughout, and learners receive a certificate on completing their course." },
  { q:"What payment methods do you accept?", a:"We accept major credit and debit cards and popular local options. Kids and Women 1:1 are monthly subscriptions; GCSE, Read & Write, Summer, and Back-to-School are a single course fee paid at enrollment." },
  { q:"Do you offer refunds?", a:"If you're not satisfied after your first paid class, contact us within 7 days and we'll refund your payment in full." },
  { q:"Is there a minimum age to start?", a:"Our Kids course welcomes learners from age 5; other courses have no upper age limit." },
  { q:"Do you teach children?", a:"Yes, from age 5, with teachers who specialize in young learners." },
  { q:"How long does it take to learn Urdu?", a:"Most learners hold simple conversations within 3–4 months of weekly classes. Reading and writing fluency take longer and depend on your goals and practice." },
  { q:"Can I switch teachers or change my plan?", a:"Absolutely. You can request a different teacher, or upgrade, downgrade, or pause your 1:1 plan at any time." },
  { q:"Can I cancel anytime?", a:"Kids and Women 1:1 plans are monthly with no long-term contract. GCSE, Read & Write, Summer, and Back-to-School are a one-time enrollment for the full course." },
